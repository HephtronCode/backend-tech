# Project: The "Inkwell" Headless CMS API

**The Client: Inkwell Media Group**, a media company that provides a platform for content creators to manage and distribute their work.

**The Problem:** Inkwell is growing rapidly. Their current workflow is a chaotic mess of google docs, spreadsheets, and emails. They need a better way to manage their content and streamline their operations.

**The Solution:** A headless CMS API that allows Inkwell to manage their content in a structured way, with a focus on scalability and ease of use.

**Core Requirements:**

- **Author Management:** Ability to create, update, and delete authors.
- **Post Management:** Ability to create, update, and delete content.
- **Critical Relationships:** Authors can have multiple posts, and posts can have multiple authors.
- **Professional Architecture:** The API should be built with a focus on scalability and maintainability, using best practices in API design.
